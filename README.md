# Cat Challenger Application

This project has been created to develop an application called Cat Challenger. This README file summarizes how the application works and outlines the operations performed.

## Project Summary

Cat Challenger is a web application that displays random cat images and provides users with a fun experience. Users can visit the application to see random cat images and can request a new cat image at any time.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/): Vue.js, a modern JavaScript framework, is used to create and manage the user interface.
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/): Bootstrap is a CSS framework used to create fast and mobile-responsive designs.

## Used API

This project utilizes the [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) service to fetch random cat images. This API is used to provide various cat images and information. The application uses this API to display random cat images to users.

The Axios library is used to access the API and fetch random cat images. Cat image URLs and other information are retrieved through API requests and presented to users. For detailed information, you can refer to [The Cat API documentation](https://docs.thecatapi.com/).
